## Webpage
Visit our website [here](https://sophia-nunez.github.io/guide-to-git/) to read about Git and various use cases. Our guide is 
designed for beginners, especially students working on projects for the first time. 

### Sections
- The **Basics** section will introduce git and the basic commands you need to know, whether you're working solo or in a group.
- The **Intermediate** section covers commands and topics not needed as a beginner, but that you may begin seeing as you use Git more often.
- The **Advanced** section is made for more complicated topics, such as branches and various merge conflicts.
- The **Troubleshooting** section focused on navigating situations when things go wrong. If you ever run into issues with file changes, check here for more information.
- Our last section is the Exercises tab. Check out this page for practice scenarios. Work on handling merge conflicts and forking repos using our tutorials - if you ever get stuck, each scenario has an associated solution for you to check out!

### Feedback Form (Coming soon)
We will soon add a Google form to our page for you to submit feedback on our guide. If you run into any issues or areas that need improvement - or you just really like our guide - let us know!
