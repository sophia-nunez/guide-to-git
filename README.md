# Guide to Git for Student Projects

Welcome to our Guide to Git! This repo was created in Spring 2025. Read below for how you can use the resources on this page.

## Webpage

Visit our website [here](https://guide-to-git.github.io/students-guide-to-git/) to read about Git and various use cases. Our guide is 
designed for beginners, especially students working on projects for the first time. 

### Sections
The **Basics** section will introduce git and the basic commands you need to know, whether you're working solo or in a group.
The **Advanced** section is made for more complicated topics, such as branches and various merge conflicts. Our last informational section is **Group Workflow**, which focuses on how to use git when working 
on group projects.

We also have a **Troubleshooting** section focused on navigating situations when things go wrong. If you ever run into issues while working through our guide, check here for more information.

## Exercises

In addition to our website, check out the **Exercises** folder in the repo for practice scenarios. Work on handling merge conflicts and forking repos using our tutorials. If you ever get stuck, each scenario has an associated solution for you to check out!
